This is a programmer for PIC microcontrollers written in C#. The ICSP/Enhanced ICSP implementation is written on C# and the hardware is little more than a USB-to-serial converter. This would allow adding support for new devices without requiring a firmware update. This project was an experiment and I'm not actively working on it at the moment.


It is a work in progress and at the moment it only works with a few dsPIC parts and only through ICSP (no enhanced ICSP). The firmware for a PIC18LF14K50 is included. I will post the board schematic when I get time.
